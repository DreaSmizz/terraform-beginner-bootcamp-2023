<h1>Instructions:</h1>
<p>1. Using either a piece of plastic wrap or an aluminum pan.  Place the piece of brisket fat side down, take a large knife
    and slice the brisket against the grain.  Take a generous amount of rub and rub it all over the underside.  Finish the side
    by slathering mustard on the meat.  Turn the meat over and complete the same process on the other side.  Cover the lid of the pan 
    or wrap the meat if using plastic wrap and allow it to sit in the refrigerator 2-4 hours.  Honestly overnight is best!
</p>
<p>
    2. Make sure your smoker has plenty of pellets in the pellet holder and turn the grill on to SMOKE or low temperature.  
    Remember, low and slow yields the best results, you can't rush a good brisket.
</p>
<p>
    3. Transfer the brisket to the grill, fat side up.  Close the lid and allow to smoke for 10-12 hours.  Every half hour 
    for the first three to four hours you will want to baste the brisket.  I like to use a mixture of beer and apple juice and 
    I apply using a spray bottle.  If you want to add a little more sweetness feel free to use honey.
</p>
<p>
    4.  Continue cooking until the internal temperature of the fattest part of the brisket is showing 140-150 degrees.  You 
    can check this using a meat thermometer.  Depending on the type of smoker you have it will come with one that you can 
    get a real time reading at any time during the cook.
</p>
<p>
    5.  Once the internal temperature has been reached, remove the brisket from the grill and using grilling aluminum foil,
    create a pouch to wrap the brisket in.  You want to add more of the mixture you have been spraying and some people use 
    some type of broth as well.
</p>
<p>
    6.  Put the pouch back on the grill and continue to cook for another one to one and a half hours.  Open the pouch and check
    the internal temperature again.  It should read 195 degrees.  It is ready to pull of the grill at this point.  Transfer to a 
    cutting board and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.  Thinly slice across the grain to serve.
</p>
<p>
    Notes:  The brisket should be firm but be able to be pulled apart using your fingers.  When you look at the slices there should
    be a ring around the meat, this is called smoke ring.  Just remember, low and slow is the way to go and have fun with it!  When
    I first started, I followed a receipe I found, after that I tried different things to put my spin on it.
